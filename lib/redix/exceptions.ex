defmodule Redix.ConnectionError do
  @moduledoc """
  Error in the connection to Redis.

  This exception represents errors in the connection to Redis: for example,
  request timeouts, disconnections, and similar.

  ## Exception fields

  This exception has the following public fields:

    * `:reason` - (atom) the error reason. It can be one of the Redix-specific
      reasons described in the "Error reasons" section below, or any error
      reason returned by functions in the `:gen_tcp` module (see the
      [`:inet.posix/0](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/inet.html#type-posix) type.

  ## Error reasons

  The `:reason` field can assume a few Redix-specific values:

    * `:closed`: when the connection to Redis is closed (and Redix is
      reconnecting) and the user attempts to talk to Redis

    * `:disconnected`: when the connection drops while a request to Redis is in
      flight.

    * `:timeout`: when Redis doesn't reply to the request in time.
