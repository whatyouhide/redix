defmodule Redix do
  @moduledoc """
  This module provides the main API to interface with Redis.

  ## Overview

  `start_link/2` starts a process that connects to Redis. Each Elixir process
  started with this function maps to a client TCP connection to the specified
  Redis server.

  The architecture is very simple: when you issue commands to Redis (via
  `command/3` or `pipeline/3`), the Redix process sends the command to Redis right
  away and is immediately able to send new commands. When a response arrives
  from Redis, only then the Redix process replies to the caller with the
  response. This pattern avoids blocking the Redix process for each request (until
  a response arrives), increasing the performance of this driver.

  ## Reconnections

  Redix tries to be as resilient as possible: it tries to recover automatically
  from most network errors.

  If there's a network error when sending data to Redis or if the connection to Redis
  drops, Redix tries to reconnect. The first reconnection attempt will happen
  after a fixed time interval; if this attempt fails, reconnections are
  attempted until successful, and the time interval between reconnections is
  increased exponentially. Some aspects of this behaviour can be configured; see
  `start_link/2` and the "Reconnections" page in the docs for more information.

  ## Sentinel

  Redix supports [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) by passing a `:sentinel`
  option to `start_link/1` (or `start_link/2`) instead of `:host` and `:port`. In `:sentinel`,
  you'll specify a list of sentinel nodes to try when connecting and the name of a primary group
  (see `start_link/1` for more detailed information on these options). When connecting, Redix will
  attempt to connect to each of the specified sentinels in the given order. When it manages to
  connect to a sentinel, it will ask that sentinel for the address of the primary for the given
  primary group. Then, it will connect to that primary and ask it for confirmation that it is
  indeed a primary. If anything in this process doesn't go right, the next sentinel in the list
  will be tried.

  All of this happens in case of disconnections as well. If there's a disconnection, the whole
  process of asking sentinels for a primary is executed again.

  You should only care about Redis Sentinel when starting a `Redix` connection: once started,
  using the connection will be exactly the same as the non-sentinel scenario.

  ## Transactions or pipelining?

  Pipelining and transactions have things in common but they're fundamentally different.
  With a pipeline, you're sending all commands in the pipeline *at once* on the connection
  to Redis. This means Redis receives all commands at once, but the Redis server is not
  guaranteed to process all those commands at once.

  On the other hand, a `MULTI`/`EXEC` transaction guarantees that when `EXEC` is called
  all the queued commands in the transaction are executed atomically. However, you don't
  need to send all the commands in the transaction at once. If you want to combine
  pipelining with `MULTI`/`EXEC` transactions, use `transaction_pipeline/3`.

  ## Skipping replies

  Redis provides commands to control whether you want replies to your commands or not.
  These commands are `CLIENT REPLY ON`, `CLIENT REPLY SKIP`, and `CLIENT REPLY OFF`.
  When you use `CLIENT REPLY SKIP`, only the command that follows will not get a reply.
  When you use `CLIENT REPLY OFF`, all the commands that follow will not get replies until
  `CLIENT REPLY ON` is issued. Redix does not support these commands directly because they
  would change the whole state of the connection. To skip replies, use `noreply_pipeline/3`
  or `noreply_command/3`.

  Skipping replies is useful to improve performance when you want to issue many commands
  but are not interested in the responses to those commands.

  > ### Blocked `CLIENT` commands {: .warning}
  >
  > Some servers may block `CLIENT` commands. For example, Google Memorystorage is [does
  > this](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/product-constraints).
  > If this is the case, the `noreply_*` functions mentioned above won't work.

  ## SSL

  Redix supports SSL by passing `ssl: true` in `start_link/1`. You can use the `:socket_opts`
  option to pass options that will be used by the SSL socket, like certificates.

  If the [CAStore](https://hex.pm/packages/castore) dependency is available, Redix will pick
  up its CA certificate store file automatically. You can select a different CA certificate
  store by passing in the `:cacertfile` or `:cacerts` socket options. If the server uses a
  self-signed certificate, such as for testing purposes, disable certificate verification by
  passing `verify: :verify_none` in the socket options.

  Some Redis servers, notably Amazon ElastiCache, use wildcard certificates that require
  additional socket options for successful verification (requires OTP 21.0 or later):

      Redix.start_link(
        host: "example.com", port: 9999, ssl: true,
        socket_opts: [
          customize_hostname_check: [
            match_fun: :public_key.pkix_verify_hostname_match_fun(:https)
          ]
        ]
      )

  ## Telemetry

  Redix uses Telemetry for instrumentation and logging. See `Redix.Telemetry`.
  """

  # This module is only a "wrapper" module that exposes the public API alongside
  # documentation for it. The real work is done in Redix.Connection and every
  # function in this module goes through Redix.Connection.pipeline/3 one way or
  # another.

  @type command() :: [String.Chars.t()]
  @type connection() :: GenServer.server()

  @default_timeout 5000

  @doc """
  Starts a connection to Redis.

  This function returns `{:ok, pid}` if the Redix process is started
  successfully.

      {:ok, pid} = Redix.start_link()

  The actual TCP connection to the Redis server may happen either synchronously,
  before `start_link/2` returns, or asynchronously. This behaviour is decided by
  the `:sync_connect` option (see below).

  This function accepts one argument which can either be an string representing
  a URI or a keyword list of options.

  ## Using in supervision trees

  Redix supports child specs, so you can use it as part of a supervision tree:

      children = [
        {Redix, host: "redix.myapp.com", name: :redix}
      ]

  See `child_spec/1` for more information.

  ## Using a Redis URI

  In case `uri_or_opts` is a Redis URI, it must be in the form:

      redis://[username:password@]host[:port][/db]

  Here are some examples of valid URIs:

    * `redis://localhost`
    * `redis://:secret@localhost:6397`
    * `redis://username:secret@localhost:6397`
    * `redis://example.com:6380/1`

  The only mandatory thing when using URIs is the host. All other elements are optional
  and their default value can be found in the "Options" section below.

  In earlier versions of Redix, the username in the URI was ignored. Redis 6 introduced [ACL
  support](https://redis.io/topics/acl). Now, Redix supports usernames as well.

  ## Options

  ### Redis options

  The following options can be used to specify the parameters used to connect to
  Redis (instead of a URI as described above):

    * `:host` - (string) the host where the Redis server is running. Defaults to
      `"localhost"`.

    * `:port` - (positive integer) the port on which the Redis server is
      running. Defaults to `6379`.

    * `:username` - (string) the username to connect to Redis. Defaults to `nil`, meaning no
      username is used. Redis supports usernames only since Redis 6 (see the [ACL
      documentation](https://redis.io/topics/acl)). If a username is provided (either via
      options or via URIs) and the Redis version used doesn't support ACL, then Redix falls
      back to using just the password and emits a warning. In future Redix versions, Redix
      will raise if a username is passed and the Redis version used doesn't support ACL.

    * `:password` - (string or MFA) the password used to connect to Redis. Defaults to
      `nil`, meaning no password is used. When this option is provided, all Redix
      does is issue an `AUTH` command to Redis in order to authenticate. MFAs are also
      supported in the form of `{module, function, arguments}`. This can be used
      to fetch the password dynamically on every reconnection but most importantly to
      hide the password from crash reports in case the Redix connection crashes for
      any reason. For example, you can use `password: {System, :fetch_env!, ["REDIX_PASSWORD"]}`.

    * `:database` - (non-negative integer or string) the database to connect to.
      Defaults to `nil`, meaning Redix doesn't connect to a specific database (the
      default in this case is database `0`). When this option is provided, all Redix
      does is issue a `SELECT` command to Redis in order to select the given database.

  ### Connection options

  The following options can be used to tweak how the Redix connection behaves.

    * `:socket_opts` - (list of options) this option specifies a list of options
      that are passed to the network layer when connecting to the Redis
      server. Some socket options (like `:active` or `:binary`) will be
      overridden by Redix so that it functions properly.

      Defaults to `[]` for TCP and `[verify: :verify_peer, depth: 3]` for SSL.
      If the `CAStore` dependency is available, the `cacertfile` option is added
      to the SSL options by default as well.

    * `:timeout` - (integer) connection timeout (in milliseconds) also directly
      passed to the network layer. Defaults to `5000`.

    * `:sync_connect` - (boolean) decides whether Redix should initiate the TCP
      connection to the Redis server *before* or *after* returning from
      `start_link/1`. This option also changes some reconnection semantics; read
      the "Reconnections" page in the docs.

    * `:exit_on_disconnection` - (boolean) if `true`, the Redix server will exit
      if it fails to connect or disconnects from Redis. Note that setting this
      option to `true` means that the `:backoff_initial` and `:backoff_max` options
      will be ignored. Defaults to `false`.

    * `:backoff_initial` - (non-negative integer) the initial backoff time (in milliseconds),
      which is the time that the Redix process will wait before
      attempting to reconnect to Redis after a disconnection or failed first
      connection. See the "Reconnections" page in the docs for more information.

    * `:backoff_max` - (positive integer) the maximum length (in milliseconds) of the
      time interval used between reconnection attempts. See the "Reconnections"
      page in the docs for more information.

    * `:name` - Redix is bound to the same registration rules as a `GenServer`. See the
      `GenServer` documentation for more information.

    * `:ssl` - (boolean) if `true`, connect through SSL, otherwise through TCP. The
      `:socket_opts` option applies to both SSL and TCP, so it can be used for things
      like certificates. See `:ssl.connect/4`. Defaults to `false`.

    * `:sentinel` - (keyword list) options for using
      [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel). If this option is provided, then the
      `:host` and `:port` option cannot be provided. For the available sentinel options, see the
      "Sentinel options" section below.

    * `:hibernate_after` - (integer) if present, the Redix connection process awaits any
      message for the given number of milliseconds and if no message is received, the process
      goes into hibernation automatically (by calling `:proc_lib.hibernate/3`). See
      `t::gen_statem.start_opt/0`. Not present by default.

    * `:spawn_opt` - (options) if present, its value is passed as options to the
      Redix connection process as in `Process.spawn/4`. See `t::gen_statem.start_opt/0`.
      Not present by default.

    * `:debug` - (options) if present, the corresponding function in the
      [`:sys` module](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/sys.html) is invoked.
      Not present by default.

  ### Sentinel options

  The following options can be used to configure the Redis Sentinel behaviour when connecting.
  These options should be passed in the `:sentinel` key in the connection options. For more
  information on support for Redis sentinel, see the `Redix` module documentation.

    * `:sentinels` - (list) a list of sentinel addresses. Each element in this list is the address
      of a sentinel to be contacted in order to obtain the address of a primary. The address of
      a sentinel can be passed as a Redis URI (see the "Using a Redis URI" section above) or
      a keyword list with `:host`, `:port`, `:password` options (same as when connecting to a
      Redis instance directly). Note that the password can either be passed in the sentinel
      address or globally -- see the `:password` option below. This option is required.

    * `:group` - (binary) the name of the group that identifies the primary in the sentinel
      configuration. This option is required.

    * `:role` - (`:primary` or `:replica`) if `:primary`, the connection will be established
      with the primary for the given group. If `:replica`, Redix will ask the sentinel for all
      the available replicas for the given group and try to connect to one of them **at random**.
      Defaults to `:primary`.

    * `:socket_opts` - (list of options) the socket options that will be used when connecting to
      the sentinels. Defaults to `[]`.

    * `:ssl` - (boolean) if `true`, connect to the sentinels via through SSL, otherwise through
      TCP. The `:socket_opts` applies to both TCP and SSL, so it can be used for things like
      certificates. See `:ssl.connect/4`. Defaults to `false`.

    * `:timeout` - (timeout) the timeout (in milliseconds or `:infinity`) that will be used to
      interact with the sentinels. This timeout will be used as the timeout when connecting to
      each sentinel and when asking sentinels for a primary. The Redis documentation suggests
      to keep this timeout short so that connection to Redis can happen quickly.

    * `:password` - (string) if you don't want to specify a password for each sentinel you
      list, you can use this option to specify a password that will be used to authenticate
      on sentinels if they don't specify a password. This option is recommended over passing
      a password for each sentinel because in the future we might do sentinel auto-discovery,
      which means authentication can only be done through a global password that works for all
      sentinels.

  Issues a pipeline of commands on the Redis server.

  `commands` must be a list of commands, where each command is a list of strings
  making up the command and its arguments. The commands will be sent as a single
  "block" to Redis, and a list of ordered responses (one for each command) will
  be returned.

  The return value is `{:ok, results}` if the request is successful, `{:error,
  reason}` otherwise.

  Note that `{:ok, results}` is returned even if `results` contains one or more
  Redis errors (`Redix.Error` structs). This is done to avoid having to walk the
  list of results (a `O(n)` operation) to look for errors, leaving the
  responsibility to the user. That said, errors other than Redis errors (like
  network errors) always cause the return value to be `{:error, reason}`.

  If `commands` is an empty list (`[]`) or any of the commands in `commands` is
  an empty command (`[]`) then an `ArgumentError` exception is raised right
  away.

  Pipelining is not the same as a transaction. For more information, see the
  module documentation.

  ## Options

    * `:timeout` - (integer or `:infinity`) request timeout (in
      milliseconds). Defaults to `#{@default_timeout}`. If the Redis server
      doesn't reply within this timeout, `{:error,
      %Redix.ConnectionError{reason: :timeout}}` is returned.
    * `:telemetry_metadata` - (map) extra metadata to add to the
      `[:redix, :pipeline, *]` Telemetry events. These end up in the `:extra_metadata`
      metadata key of these events. See `Redix.Telemetry`.

  Issues a command on the Redis server.

  This function sends `command` to the Redis server and returns the response
  returned by Redis. `pid` must be the pid of a Redix connection. `command` must

  The return value is `{:ok, response}` if the request is successful and the
  response is not a Redis error. `{:error, reason}` is returned in case there's
  an error in the request (such as losing the connection to Redis in between the
  request). `reason` can also be a `Redix.Error` exception in case Redis is

    * if the command is successful, then the result is returned directly (not wrapped in a
      `{:ok, result}` tuple).
    * if there's a Redis error or a connection error, a `Redix.Error` or `Redix.ConnectionError`
      error is raised.

  This function accepts the same options as `command/3`.

  ## Examples

      iex> Redix.command!(conn, ["SET", "mykey", "foo"])
      "OK"

      iex> Redix.command!(conn, ["INCR", "mykey"])
      ** (Redix.Error) ERR value is not an integer or out of range

  If Redis goes down (before a reconnection happens):

      iex> Redix.command!(conn, ["GET", "mykey"])
      ** (Redix.ConnectionError) :closed

  Same as `command/3` but tells the Redis server to not return a response.

  This function is useful when you want to send a command but you don't care about the response.
  Since the response is not returned, the return value of this function in case the command
  is successfully sent to Redis is `:ok`.

  Not receiving a response means saving traffic on the network and memory allocation for the
  response. See also `noreply_pipeline/3`.

  This function accepts the same options as `pipeline/3`.

  Executes a `MULTI`/`EXEC` transaction.

  Redis supports something akin to transactions. It works by sending a `MULTI` command,
  then some commands, and then an `EXEC` command. All the commands after `MULTI` are
  queued until `EXEC` is issued. When `EXEC` is issued, all the responses to the queued
  commands are returned in a list.

  This function accepts the same options as `pipeline/3`.

  ## Examples

  To run a `MULTI`/`EXEC` transaction in one go, use this function and pass a list of
  commands to use in the transaction:

      iex> Redix.transaction_pipeline(conn, [["SET", "mykey", "foo"], ["GET", "mykey"]])
      {:ok, ["OK", "foo"]}

  ## Problems with transactions

  There's an inherent problem with Redix's architecture and `MULTI`/`EXEC` transaction.
  A Redix process is a single connection to Redis that can be used by many clients. If
  a client A sends `MULTI` and client B sends a command before client A sends `EXEC`,
  client B's command will be part of the transaction. This is intended behaviour, but
  it might not be what you expect. This is why `transaction_pipeline/3` exists: this function
  wraps `commands` in `MULTI`/`EXEC` but *sends all in a pipeline*. Since everything
  is sent in the pipeline, it's sent at once on the connection and no commands can
  end up in the middle of the transaction.

  ## Running `MULTI`/`EXEC` transactions manually

  There are still some cases where you might want to start a transaction with `MULTI`,
  then send commands from different processes that you actively want to be in the
  transaction, and then send an `EXEC` to run the transaction. It's still fine to do
  this with `command/3` or `pipeline/3`, but remember what explained in the section
  above. If you do this, do it in an isolated connection (open a new one if necessary)
  to avoid mixing things up.
