> Superfast, pipelined, resilient Redis client for Elixir.

![Cover image](http://i.imgur.com/ZG2RXsb.png)

Redix is a [Redis][redis] client written in pure Elixir with focus on speed,
correctness and resiliency (that is, being able to automatically reconnect to
Redis in case of network errors).

Note that this README refers to the `master` branch of Redix, not the latest
released version on Hex. See [the documentation](http://hexdocs.pm/redix) for
the documentation of the version you're using.

## Installation

Add the `:redix` dependency to your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
defp deps() do
  [{:redix, ">= 0.0.0"}]
end
```

If using Elixir < 1.4 or not using `:extra_applications`, add `:redix` to your
list of applications:

```elixir
defp application() do
  [applications: [:logger, :redix]]
end
```

Then, run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch the new dependency.

## Usage

Redix is very simple in that it doesn't wrap Redis commands with Elixir
functions: it only provides two functions (with their bang! variants),
`command/3` and `pipeline/3`. A Redis *command* is expressed as a list of
strings making up the command and its arguments.

Connections are started via `start_link/0`, `start_link/1` or
`start_link/2`. These functions accept Redix-specific options as well as all the
options accepted by `GenServer.start_link/3` (e.g., `:name` for registering the
connection process under a name).

```elixir
{:ok, conn} = Redix.start_link()
{:ok, conn} = Redix.start_link(host: "example.com", port: 5000)
{:ok, conn} = Redix.start_link("redis://localhost:6379/3", name: :redix)
```

Commands can be sent using `Redix.command/2-3`:

```elixir
Redix.command(conn, ["SET", "mykey", "foo"])
#=> {:ok, "OK"}
Redix.command(conn, ["GET", "mykey"])
#=> {:ok, "foo"}
```

Pipelines are just lists of commands sent all at once to Redis for which Redis
replies with a list of responses. They can be used in Redix via
`Redix.pipeline/2,3`:

```elixir
Redix.pipeline(conn, [["INCR", "foo"], ["INCR", "foo"], ["INCRBY", "foo", "2"]])
#=> {:ok, [1, 2, 4]}
```

`Redix.command/2,3` and `Redix.pipeline/2,3` always return `{:ok, result}` or
`{:error, reason}`. If you want to access the result directly and raise in case
there's an error, bang! variants are provided:

```elixir
Redix.command!(conn, ["PING"])
#=> "PONG"

Redix.pipeline!(conn, [["SET", "mykey", "foo"], ["GET", "mykey"]])
#=> ["OK", "foo"]
```

`Redix.command/2,3` and `Redix.pipeline/2,3` return a `Redix.ConnectionError` struct in
case there's an error related to the Redis connection (for example, the connection is
closed while Redix is waiting to reconnect).

#### Resiliency

Redix takes full advantage of the [Connection][connection] library by James
Fish to provide a resilient behaviour when dealing with the network connection
to Redis. For example, if the connection to Redis drops, Redix will
automatically try to reconnect to it periodically at a given "backoff" interval
(which is configurable). Look at the documentation for the `Redix` module and to
the ["Reconnections" page][docs-reconnections] in the documentation for more
information on the available options and on the exact behaviour regarding
reconnections.

#### Pub/Sub

Redix doesn't support the Pub/Sub features of Redis. For that, there's
[`redix_pubsub`][redix-pubsub].

#### `no_wait_for_reply`

If you don't want to wait for a reply from Redis, use the `no_wait_for_reply: true` option to `command/3`/`pipeline/3`. This uses the [`CLIENT REPLY SKIP`](https://redis.io/commands/client-reply) feature to instruct Redis to not send a reply at all. With this option, `command/3` and `pipeline/3` return `:ok`; the bang variants return `nil`.

```elixir
Redix.command(conn, ["SET", "mykey", "foo"], no_wait_for_reply: true)
#=> :ok

Redix.command!(conn, ["SET", "mykey", "foo"], no_wait_for_reply: true)
#=> nil
```
In the case of a connection error, they behave as normal (returning `{:error, error}` with a `Redix.ConnectionError`), but you won't get any feedback for other errors (that is, errors returned by Redis in response to the command) — they'll just fail silently.

## Using Redix in the Real World™

Redix is low-level, but it's still built to handle most things thrown at
it. Most people tend to use pooling with Redix (through something like
[poolboy][poolboy]), but for many applications, that can be avoided with little
to no impact on performance. Read the
["Real world usage" page][docs-real-world-usage] in the documentation for more
information on this.

## Contributing

Clone the repository and run `$ mix test` to make sure everything is
working. For tests to pass, you must have a Redis server running on `localhost`,
port `6379`. Both may be configured using the environment variables `REDIX_TEST_HOST` and
`REDIX_TEST_PORT` respectively. Tests will wipe clean all the databases on the running Redis
server, as they call `FLUSHALL` multiple times, so *be careful*.
